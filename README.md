# Exploring the World of Anime Faces through Variational Autoencoding

## 🔄 Overview:
In this project, we will delve into the world of anime by training a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) on a dataset of anime faces. By using this model, we will be able to explore the unique features and styles present in anime art. Our VAE model will be trained using Tensorflow and the anime faces dataset by MckInsey666.

## 🎊 Motivation:
Anime is a unique form of art that has gained immense popularity over the years. Through this project, we aim to understand the visual characteristics of anime faces and the patterns that make it so distinct. By training a VAE model, we can generate new anime faces, which can open up new avenues for creativity and self-expression in the anime community.

## 🏁 Learning Objectives:
1)	Gain hands-on experience in building and training a VAE model.
2)	Familiarize oneself with the Tensorflow library.
3)	Learn how to preprocess and prepare image datasets for training.
4)	Develop an understanding of the principles behind generative models.

## ⚙️ Technical Aspects:
In this project, we will be using Tensorflow, Numpy, and Matplotlib. The anime faces dataset by MckInsey666 will be downloaded and preprocessed for training. The VAE model will be built using Tensorflow and trained on the preprocessed dataset. The trained model will then be used to generate new anime faces and visualize the reconstructed images.

## 🧰 Technology used:
The project will use Tensorflow, Numpy and Matplotlib.

## 📚 Data Source:
Anime faces dataset by MckInsey666-.

## 🗂️ Project Structure:
The project will consist of the following stages.
1)	Imports and parameters
2)	Download and preparation of the dataset
3)	Building the VAE model
4)	Training the VAE model
5)	Plotting reconstructed and generated images
6)	Saving the trained model
